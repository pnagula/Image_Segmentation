# Image Segmentation - U-NET Architecture
The u-net is convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images.The U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg, Germany. The network is based on the fully convolutional network [2] and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Each blue box corresponds to a multi-channel feature map. The number of channels is denoted on top of the box. The x-y-size is provided at the lower left edge of the box. White boxes represent copied feature maps. The arrows denote the different operations.
